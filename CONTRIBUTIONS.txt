(a) The functionalities that each person contributed to in the submitted QA
system. For example, one person might have written the code for question
classification while the other person wrote the code for extracting answer
phrases.

Most of the assignment was coded in a pair programming style. After a while we
would switch roles.

Sephora coded the majority of qa.py (which handles reading the information
from the files and organizing it), with the exception of the argument parser.
Jesse offered advice and input for qa.py to help out and then Jesse coded the
answer finding in the helpers.py with input from Sephora, who came up with the
idea of using signature vectors to try to narrow down which sentence to look at.
Sephora also coded the majority of the file readers contained in helpers.py
before they were refactored into a separate file from qa.py.


(b) A list of the submitted source code files that each person had PRIMARY
responsibility for. In most cases, each source code file should be listed for
just 1 person. But if the code for two distinct functionalities are in the same
file, then indicate that.

    helpers.py -> Jesse
    qa.py -> Sephora
