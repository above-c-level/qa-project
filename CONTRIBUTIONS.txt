(a) The functionalities that each person contributed to in the submitted QA system. 
For example, one person might have written the code for question classification while 
the other person wrote the code for extracting answer phrases.

Most of the assignment was coding in a pair programming style. That means one while one person coded the other would
watch and suggest certain structures or approaches. Then after a while we would switch roles. 

Sephora coded the qa.py(which handles reading the information from the files and organizing it) 
with Jesse offering advice and input and then Jessie coded the answer finding in the helpers.py 
with input from Sephora.  


(b) A list of the submitted source code files that each person had PRIMARY responsibility for.
 In most cases, each source code file should be listed for just 1 person. But if the code for 
 two distinct functionalities are in the same file, then indicate that.

 Helpers.py -> Jesse
 qa.py -> Sephora
